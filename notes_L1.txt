The following notes are a summary of the side notes in cryptozombies.io tutorial ["Making the zombie factory"] a.k.a: lesson 1.

Chptr 2:
- Contracts: Solidity is encapsulated in contracts. 
- Every Solidity source should begin with Pragma and the version of any compiler your going to use.

Chptr 3:
- State variables are permanently sotred in contracts storage. (is like writing to a DB).
    ex.: uint aNewVariable = 100; in this case we created a uint and set it equal to 100. 
-->uint means unsigned integrers.

Chptr 4: 
- Math Operators: 
    -->Addition: x + y
    -->Subtraction: x - y,
    -->Multiplication: x * y
    -->Division: x / y
    -->Modulus / remainder: x % y (for example, 13 % 5 is 3, because if you divide 5 into 13, 3 is the remainder)
    -->Exponential: x ** y  means => x^y.

Chptr 5: 
Structs: (like in c) to use a complex data type. 
    ex.: struct Person{
        uint age;
        string name;
    }

Chptr 6:
